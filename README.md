# cognixia-capstone
This project is a closed project that we made using the https://github.com/saikiranchalla1/learning-docker-kubernetes-on-azure-aks/blob/capstone-project/0_Capstone-Project/README.md as guide on how to complete the project.
In this project we made a pipeline using AzureDevops and Azure to host a Kubernetes service that ran a Docker image in different namespace. 

The image was generated using the Spring Initializer, and edited to meet the criteria.

We also made readiness probes and kube-manifests to ensure that our code and process can be replicated.
